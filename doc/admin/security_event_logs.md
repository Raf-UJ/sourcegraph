# Security Event Logs
This guide goes into the details of Securit Event Logging in Sourcegraph
> Note: You can find more information about our audit logs setup [here](./audit_log.md)
>
> [Here](../dev/how-to/add_logging.md) is a guide on how to add logging to Sourcegraph backend

## What are Security Event Logs
- The purpose of Security Event Logs is to allow security specialists to be able to trace the steps of a user or an admin across the application.
- Getting a full picture, of how a user moves through the application, in a single location is crucial for many reasons.
- When a user takes an action on a sensitive part of the application, this should be logged to make sure it can be retraced to a user and time.
- In Sourcegraph application, we log these sensitive actions as "security event" with relevant information included in the output.
- These logs can be enabled/disabled as well as the location can be set via the [site config settings](./audit_log#configuring)


## How to log a security event
- All the logging for security event is done through our [security_event_log.go](https://sourcegraph.com/github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/-/blob/internal/database/security_event_logs.go) functions
- To log an event, the [LogSecurityEvent](https://sourcegraph.com/github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/-/blob/internal/database/security_event_logs.go?L253:34&popover=pinned) function can be invoked which creates an event with information provided and then submits it for logging to the right place
- This function takes following information to create a log event
  - Context from the where the log is being called
  - SecurityEventName which is predefined [here](https://sourcegraph.com/github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/-/blob/internal/database/security_event_logs.go?L22-101)
  - URL if available
  - userID of the user that the action is applied towards
  - anonymousUserID for unauthenitcated users
  - source of the log
  - arguments relevant to the action
- Example of invoking the function
  ```go
  db.SecurityEventLogs().LogSecurityEvent(ctx, database.SecurityEventNameEmailVerified, r.URL.Path, uint32(actr.UID), "", "BACKEND", email)

- The function sends the log event it creates to be pushed to the right location based on the site-config settings
- The function also checks to make sure that marshalling the arguments does not cause as error

## How to find security events in logs
- Security events are logged with all the relevant information associated with the actions
- Depending on the location of the log destination, the event log can be either found in your application log output or in the database or both.
- A sample output of a logged event from application logs would look similar to this:
  ```JSON
  {
  ...
  {
    "message": "EmailAdded (sampling immunity token: 12345-222-3333-5454-9w08fs0s9d8f)",
    "Caller": "audit/audit.go:57",
    "Attributes": {
      "audit": {
        "actor": {
          "X-Forwarded-For": "127.0.0.1",
          "userAgent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) ",
          "ip": "100.211.3.155",
          "actorUID": "123245"
        },
        "entity": "security events",
        "auditId": "12345-222-3333-5454-9w08fs0s9d8f",
        "action": "EmailAdded"
      },
      "event": {
        "URL": "",
        "argument": "\"new@sourcegraph.com\"",
        "AnonymousUserID": "",
        "UserID": 223955,
        "source": "12345",
        "timestamp": "2023-12-21 02:41:08.649603776 +0000 UTC",
        "version": "255367_2023-12-20_5.2-a3143120c41e"
      }
    },
    "Function": "github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/internal/audit.Log",
    "InstrumentationScope": "frontend.SecurityEvents",
    "timestampNanos": 1703126468649641000,
    "Resource": {
      "service.instance.id": "sourcegraph-frontend-769bdbdd77-p2f8j",
      "service.name": "frontend",
      "service.version": "255367_2023-12-20_5.2-a3143120c41e"
    }
  }
  ...
  }

- Entity field can be used to filter out all security events
- Action field will provide information on the event and can be correlated with the action taken, in this case EmailAdded
- The actorUID can be used to filter out events from a particular user
- UseriD can be used to filter out events taken on a particular user's information
-
